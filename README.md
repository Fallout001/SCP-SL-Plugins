# EffectOnHUD

# Summary

Hi, My name Is Fallout and this is my collection of plugins i have made for SCP:SL Using The Exiled Framework

**EffectOnHud** - A serverside Keybind a user can press to show a compact display of their current status effects

**XpPopulationLimiter** - A hook to The Xp system made by "moddedmcplayer" that allows control of when players get xp to under a certain player count - this was made to avoid people from abusing the xp gain in lower player lobbies


**Welcome Message** - A simple plugin to show the player a small hint when they just connect to the server (on verified)
